# oneartplease

A stupid experiment in generative art. Although it doesn't really look like it on the surface, this
project is **not safe for work**.

Here's a mediocre quality 20 second recording: https://gfycat.com/OrderlyShowyAfricanwilddog

## install

You'll want Python 3, pip, a web browser, and probably around 15Mbit/s of downstream internet speed
(using default settings).

    (optionally: make a python3 virtualenv)
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    python3 oneartplease.py

Then navigate to `127.0.0.1:48230` in your browser.

## usage

You can click after the page is loaded to see how the sausage is made. Don't say I didn't warn you.

There's also a few flags you can pass to the program to change its behavior,
you can see them by running with the help flag:

    python3 oneartplease.py --help
